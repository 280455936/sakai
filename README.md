# Simple RSS Portlet

An RSS/Atom feed reader portlet.

### Features
* Renders all forms of RSS and Atom feeds
* Prioritises and displays images contained in the feed
* Feeds and images are cached for quick access
* Can be setup as a portlet publishing type to allow multiple pre configured portlets to be deployed.
* Supports the CONFIG mode for run-time configuration
* Designed to be a drop in replacement for the deprecated CSyndFeed channel (uses the same markup).
